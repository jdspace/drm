You put on headphones and, using your phone, you open an app that allows you to move your body up to 300ft while hearing spatially anchored audio and background sounds. The app provides embodied ‘journeys’ and other experiences —some of which are narrative-driven, fictional stories — that are centered on topics such as: walking meditations; mindful emotion regulation; celebration; ambient exploration; connection with nature; creative play (ex., embodied music making); meaningful rituals; and deep-thinking assistance. New series are added regularly, created by artists, storytellers, scientists, and wisdom teachers.
