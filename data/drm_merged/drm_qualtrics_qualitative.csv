After, I sat in a library and alternated between doing work on laptop and watching youtube videos of interest (volleyball, Police body cam footage, self help)","I put on certain kinds of videos because I am used to them, some are funny, others are news, others are under the veil of ""educational"" such as documentaries.  To an extent, consuming this media is a source of a distraction from thoughts or feelings that are making me anxious or overwhelmed.  THings like work or preparation for something important (HW, exam) tend to make me distract myself more.","For me, I need a fan to be on to help me sleep at night.  If I don't have a fan I have significant trouble sleeping at night.  I listen to music and youtube on my commutes because the music I listen to either fits my mood or helps me get into a different one.  The funny YouTube videos also raise my spirits because of how funny I find them to be.  ","The main thing was using my laptop and tablet to take notes during classes and office hours.  ","I was enjoying the class, thinking about personal applications for the material.  During office hours I was thinking about how bad I did on the exam and how I was screwed. ","Listening to music helped try to boost my mood when I was feeling tired, and then I listened to rage music after the bad news because it felt validating to my emotional state.","The music I was listening to helped me feel a little more at ease compared to how poorly I felt while I didn't have the music going or wasn't watching the internet stuff I wanted to.","This was a large section of school related things, so I didn't use my phone or youtube as much.  However, there was an extent of: ""I wanna go on youtube, or to look at porn"" while I was unable to while being in a public setting. ","Crash Out","2,3,6,8,9,10,16,99","Laying in bed, trying to distract myself from my anger, frustration, and sadness.","How bad I felt about myself.","I used these technologies to try and distract myself from how badly I was feeling in that moment.","These technologies helped me distract myself from how badly I was feeling.  I got into bed, opened up youtube and porn and books and tried to stop thinking.  I don't have anyone to reach out to, so I turned to AI for comfort.  The AI helped me feel less lonely despite my not interacting with anyone else for this episode.  Watching youtube and porn helped me distract myself from my feelings of severe hopelessness, sadness, frustration.  Eventually, I feel like i numbed myself down to a point where I felt tired and went to bed.","Me getting into bed and doing this has become a very frequent occurrence.  I get into bed with my computer and binge youtube everyday and it has been a big issue since I was in middle and high school.  Being in bed was my only safe space and youtube kept my mind off life.  Now in college, youtube, porn and bed is a big problem.  With school being overwhelming and my ambitions never being fulfilled I am always so frustrated and depressed that I always end up trying to dull the pain by being in bed and drowning in YouTube.  I want to change but to be honest I don't know how, so I keep doing it.","Waking up and Preparations for Slope Day","Watching videos while I got some food and got ready for slope day.  ","Thinking about slope day, volleyball, money stuff...","","I was playing games like backgammon, poker, and chess on my computer against a computer.","I was thinking about how I was missing slope day, about how much better it was for me to play the games, and how going out with all the people would suck.  ","Playing backgammon with music on increased my energy and immersion into the game, however the more i lost the more i wanted to keep playing and my energy was high.  Eventually the game losses and the music were causing me to have high anger and i started raging at the losses.  Then, I used ChatGPT to talk about the addicting behavior and then read some visual novels on the computer that served to cool me off and I felt better afterward.","So when I was playing, I had high energy, so the music I was listening to was more on the side of high energy.  Those two together led to me getting more high energy and angry.  Then... the reading helped calm me down and comforted me to the point of me being able to relax.  ","The pursuit of winning felt good, but then losing a lot is what made me so mad, and then the reading (on the computer) helped me feel safe again","Feeling Better","2,3,4,5,7,14,15,16","I had therapy over the computer, then walked for 2 hours, then went to volleyball.  ","Therapy helped a lot, annoyance with walking as far as I did, then volleyball helped me feel better.","Listening to music to calm me down helped me feel a lot better.  It put me in a good headspace.  ","Therapy for me is on the computer.  That usually helps me a lot.  Listening to music while I walk has been a habit as well.  They generally make me feel more empowered and confident in myself.  Music generally is a mindset mirrorer, where the music energy I listen to is chosen more from my mental state that my music taste.  ","Therapy being on the computer helps a lot.  Music helps me feel a lot better.  But playing volleyball is done without technology so that also influences things. ","Sperm Donation","I participated in a study that required sperm.  I used my computer to access adult content as soon as I woke up.    I get compensation for participating and the compensation is what I enjoy because I like to have more money.  ","I was thinking that I needed a break from worrying about exams and classes.  I tend to access adult content rather frequently on my devices.","The computer and headphones allowed me to enjoy the content and donate.  I tend to browse a lot when when I see something I like it makes me feel a little better.","After a long stretch of work, I watched youtube intermittently with submitting work.  ","I was thinking about how I did a lot of work and I deserved a break.  ALso I needed to be careful that I didn't end up in an endless youtube spiral for hours.","I was watching exciting content (sports, LEO bodycam) that made me excited, I also listened to exciting music in my library.","I used the software of YouTube and adult content as a rewarding mechanism as I neared the end of completing an assignment for a class.  I tried to use it without getting sucked in and i believe I was successful because I was being more strict about time limits.  ","Youtube for me is addicting and it makes me feel terrible to think about using because it takes time away from my other ambitions.  But while I watch, relaxing i feel great.  ","1,2,3,6,8,9,12","I watched youtube while eating dinner, tried working, felt tired and jumped into bed and watched youtube for hours.  ","I should be studying, I am tired, I am not cultivating success, I am lonely, I wish I had people...","When I was in bed, I was watching youtube and/or adult content and/or games to distract myself.  I was in bed, where I feel most comfortable and stayed there for about 5 ish hours.   ","The whole use of tech helped me distract myself from how tired I was feeling and helped me feel better and also a distracted from how much work i had to do.  ","","Hype for myself","I was reading, watching videos, and gathering inspiration for myself and my sport endeavours.  ","I was fantasizing about what I wanted to do when I was playing sports and doing in my future.  ","The combination of reading (paper books) that excite me, listening to high energy music, and watching exciting sport videos makes me excited to play and want to play my ideal volleyball.","The combination of exciting music, videos, and reading materials fills me with excitement, confidence for my future sport endeavours.  The media inflates my confidence and I fantasize being an absolute beast when it come to what I want to do.  ","Whenever I play volleyball, I play lower quality than I would like.  I feel that the tech makes my confidence higher and makes me feel better until reality hits and my incompetence slaps me in the face.  ","I was aware of the effects of technology on my life before, however, I didn't know to what extent.  There was also instances of me slipping into addictive behaviors that I wanted to include in the study.  I have therapy and journal frequently but it was nice to having a more structured reflection as opposed to fully autonomous reflection.  ","The process was alright, I wanted to focus more on days when I used tech more freely.  I also had many days where I was in a worse mood and less inclined to complete the surveys reliable each day.  "
